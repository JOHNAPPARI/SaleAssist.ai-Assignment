Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### React application's main component (`App.js`). This component imports several other components and renders them within its structure. 

1. Importing CSS file (`App.css`) and various components (`Navbar`, `ProductsList`, `ProductsDetails`, and `MyComponent`).
2. Defining the `App` function component.
3. Inside the `App` component:
    => Rendering a `<div>` with the class name "App".
    => Inside this `<div>`:
        => Rendering the `Navbar` component.
        => Rendering the `ProductsList` component.
        => Rendering the `ProductsDetails` component twice. (You import and use `ProductsDetails` both as `ProductsDetails` and as `MyComponent`.)
4. Exporting the `App` component as the default export of this file.

### `Navbar` component it is a functional component written in JSX, representing the navigation bar of your application. It contains links to different sections of your website and some icons. Here's a breakdown of the component:

1. It renders a `<nav>` element with a class of "flex items-center justify-between flex-wrap bg-[#000] p-6", 
    which likely sets up a navigation bar with some styling (e.g., flex layout, background color, padding).
2. Inside the `<nav>` element, it contains:
    => A logo or brand name "TANN TRIM".
    => A menu button for toggling the navigation menu on small screens (mobile).
    => Navigation links (<a> elements) for different sections like "Bags", "Travel", "Accessories", "Gifting", and "Jewelry".
    => Some social media icons, possibly for linking to your social media profiles.


### `MyComponent` function is a React functional component that fetches a list of products from the "https://fakestoreapi.com/products" API endpoint and renders them in a UI. Here's a breakdown of the component:

1. State Variables:
    => `products`: Holds the array of products fetched from the API.
    => `isLoading`: Tracks whether the data is still being loaded.
    => `error`: Holds any error that might occur during the API call.
    => `number`: Holds a count, initialized to 0, which can be increased by clicking a button.

2. increaseNumber Function: This function is triggered when a button is clicked and increments the `number` state by 1.

3. useEffect Hook: This hook is responsible for fetching the products from the API when the component mounts. 
   It sets the `products` state with the fetched data. If there's an `error` during the fetch, it updates the error state.

4. Conditional Rendering:
    => If `isLoading` is true, it displays "Loading...".
    => If there's an `error`, it displays the error message.
    =>If neither `isLoading` nor `error` is true, it renders the products fetched from the API.

5. Rendering Products: It maps over the `products` array and renders each product's details, 
    including its image, title, price, rating, and count. There's also a button associated with each product that, when clicked, calls the `increaseNumber` function to increment the `number` state.
